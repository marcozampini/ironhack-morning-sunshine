        <h3>Personal Development</h3>
        <p>
          Personal development consists of activities that develop a person's
          capabilities and potential, build human capital, facilitate
          employability, and enhance quality of life and the realization of
          dreams and aspirations.

        <h3>Synonims of Personal Development</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal Growth</li>
          <li>Self-Improvement</li>
          <li>Self-Growth</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          When we speak about personal development we often use the way of
          thinking of the spirit of this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must run, you must improve yourself, you must be productive, you
          must do, you must demonstrate that you have changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this brings a lot of anxieties and often leads to the balance
          sheets of their year and their history as is done with company
          turnover and therefore with the idea that one must constantly
          accumulate and increase one's inner turnover.
        </p>

          While this can be good for a company, it's not good for one person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal growth is often a set of techniques that are applied to a
          person who, however, has something unique, to which something standard
          cannot be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason Maura Gancitano and Andrea Colamedici have recovered
          the idea of personal flowering / personal flourishing / personal
          bloom.

        <h3>Personal Bloom</h3>
        <p>
          The expression "Personal bloom" comes from Ancient Greek practices of
          <em>epimeleia heautou</em>, or techniques of “care of the self”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal bloom is <em>self-care</em>, while personal development is
          <em>work on oneself</em>, that implies effort, a goal to achieve, a
          constant anxiety that the society of performance constantly pushes us
          to have.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          A personal bloom process is a process in which a person feels
          himself/herself in motion, the person feels that he/she is acting but
          in his/her own way, at their own pace, according to one's vocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the sensation to feel more in harmony with yourself and your
          desires.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          Those who practice personal flowering want a process that can be
          individual or collective that has to do with listening to oneself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a process of care and curiosity (cura e curiosità have the same
          etymological root), care about themselves, of their own spaces, of
          their own time, and also be curious, that is feeling in motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our brain doesn't need to mull over things, it needs to act, the human
          being is made to act, but everyone needs to act in a different way,
          according to their peculiarity and one's vocation.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          The process of personal bloom helps to feel in harmony, to feel free
          to rediscover yourself, your pace and therefore to find your
          direction.
