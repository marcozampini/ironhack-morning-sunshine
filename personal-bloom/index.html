        <h2>Personal Bloom vs Personal Development</h2>
        <h3>Personal Development</h3>
        <p>
          Personal development consists of activities that develop a person's
          capabilities and potential, build human capital, facilitate
          employability, and enhance quality of life and the realization of
          dreams and aspirations
        </p>

        <h3>Synonims of Personal Development</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal Growth</li>
          <li>Self-Improvement</li>
          <li>Self-Growth</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          When we speak about personal development we often use the way of
          thinking of the spirit of this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must run, you must improve yourself, you must be productive, you
          must do, you must demonstrate that you have changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this brings a lot of anxieties and often leads to the balance
          sheets of their year and their history as is done with company
          turnover
        </p>
        <p>
          and therefore with the idea that one must constantly accumulate and
          increase one's inner turnover
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          While this can be good for a company, it's not good for one person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal growth is often a set of techniques that are applied to a
          person who, however, has something unique, to which something standard
          cannot be applied
        </p>
        <p>
          for this reason maura gancitano and andrea colamedici have recovered
          the idea of personal flowering / personal flourishing / personal bloom
        </p>
      </section>

        <p>
          The expression "Personal bloom" comes from Ancient Greek practices of
          <em>epimeleia heautou</em>, or techniques of “care of the self”
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal bloom is <em>self-care</em>, while personal development is
          <em>work on oneself</em>, that implies effort, a goal to achieve, a
          constant anxiety that the society of performance constantly pushes us
          to have
        </p>

        <p>
          A personal bloom process is a process in which a person feels
          himself/herself in motion, the person feels that he/she is acting but
          in his/her own way, at their own pace, according to one's vocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the sensation to feel more in harmony with yourself and your
          desires
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          those who practice personal flowering want a process that can be
          individual or collective that has to do with listening to oneself
        </p>
        <p>
          it is a process of care and curiosity (cura e curiosità have the same
          etymological root), care about themselves, of their own spaces, of
          their own time, and also be curious, that is feeling in motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our brain doesn't need to mull over things, it needs to act, the human
          being is made to act, but everyone needs to act in a different way,
          according to their peculiarity and one's vocation/
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        The process of personal bloom helps to feel in harmony, to feel free to
        rediscover yourself, your pace and therefore to find your direction
